gzk
===

gzip keep - little bash script to run gzip on a file nondestructively



### Usage:

`$ gzk yo-mamma.file` results in `yo-mamma.file.gzip` being created while the `yo-mamma.file` is left intact. 


### Install: 

For now, git clone this repo, cd into the directory and run: `mv gzk /usr/local/bin`. 

Might want to double check your perms on the file, if you have problems, you'll have to chmod the gzk file.
